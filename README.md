Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis in the Hospitality Domain

Project Description:
This project involves conducting a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights that can drive decision-making in the hospitality industry. The dataset used in this project includes key attributes such as customer demographics, booking patterns, revenue trends, and customer feedback. By systematically cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data, the project aims to identify trends, correlations, and actionable insights that can help improve customer experiences, optimize operations, and boost revenue generation.

Key Features:

1) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
    * Addressed missing values and handled outliers.
    * Ensured data consistency and integrity for reliable analysis.
2) Data Transformation:
    * Standardized and normalized variables to enhance data quality.
    * Prepared the dataset for advanced visualization and analysis.
3) Exploratory Analysis:
    * Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
    * Explored correlations, distributions, and key trends in the dataset.
4) Data Visualization:
    * Created interactive and static visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
    * Presented findings in an easily interpretable format for stakeholders.
5) Insights Generation:
    * Identified peak booking times and customer preferences.
    * Analyzed factors influencing customer satisfaction.
    * Provided recommendations to enhance business operations and customer retention.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

What I Learned:
